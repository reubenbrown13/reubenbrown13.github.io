    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently given a Samsung Galaxy S4 for Sprint to help refurbish because the owner was having issues with it running hot all the time.  I searched the internet and found this to be a common issue that is resolved by turning off everything you can and putting the device into power saving mode.  This is not ideal, but it did help the phone to not get so hot some of the time.  The core issue turned out to be the Samsung TouchWiz system is a bit of a CPU hog.  After using stock AOSP, CM, and other ROMs based on AOSP it is hard for me to see what there is to like about TouchWiz.  It&#8217;s ugly and clunky in my opinion.  So the hut began for an alternative.</p>

<p>I found several <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-sprint/#romList">ROMS</a> to choose from in the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA-Developers forum</a> dedicated to the S4 for Sprint.  After much trial and error I decided to use the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3026930">AICP ROM</a> to start with since it would give me the latest release.  This worked well until I discovered that the S4 can be unlocked to work on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2530610">domestic GSM networks</a>.</p>


<p>I followed the guide using a non-stock TouchWiz ROM since I had already wiped out the original ROM.  Everything seemed to be working except I could not fully make or receive phone calls.  I tried then flashing several other ROMs, but could never get it to fully work.  I then went to the <a href="http://galaxys4root.com/">galaxys4root.com</a> site to download the latest <a href="http://galaxys4root.com/galaxy-s4-stock-firmware/">KitKat Rom</a> for the L720.  I used Odin to flash it and booted the system to see what would happen.  After much waiting on the first flash, I had to reboot the phone a couple times to get everything to load.  There were some errors showing on the screen, but I was able to load the phone dialer and make a call!  This was quite exciting, but I was worried that I was going to be stuck with a broken TouchWiz system.  I decided to then try one more thing.</p>


<p>I downloaded the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s4-sprint/development/rom-5-0google-play-edition-lrx219-12-24-t2982384">Google Play Edition ROM</a> and installed it using <a href="http://twrp.me/devices/samsunggalaxys4sprint.html">TWRP</a> which I had installed using <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2012/06/heimdall-odin-alternative-that-runs-on.html">heimdall</a> (sudo heimdall flash &#8211;RECOVERY recovery.img).  Once the GPE ROM was setup and installed, there were no more errors and tons of Lollipop goodness to be enjoyed.  The GPE ROM has an OTA feature that helps keep things updated and has additional packages that can be baked into the ROM like ad blocking.  I tested my phone call situation, and things are working GREAT.  All functions of the phone seem to work without issue.</p>


<p>From what I can see in the forums is that LTE might not work, but I am used to only have HSPA access and don&#8217;t use mobile data all that often since I am using H2O wireless which is an ATT MVNO.  I did have to configure my APN for H2O manually.  I used the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-H2O-Wireless-to-an-Android-Phone">settings from wikiHow.com</a> to get the data and mms working.  Over all, I am very pleased so far with the phone and it is running quite cool since it was updated to GPE.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While searching for help on a project I am working on, I noticed one of my <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/" target="_new">peers</a>, tho I hesitate to say that I am even in the same class of developer that he is, had changed their blogging platform over to <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_new">Octopress</a>.  I have used several systems in the past but always desired to have a certain level of control.  I loathed the idea of using WordPress and having a blog hosted on their servers.  The idea of using something so nerd-centric really appealed to me.  The install and setup guide looked like a very simple thing to follow.  This proved to be mostly true&#8230;.</p>


<!-- more -->


<p>When following the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/" target="_new">Setup Guide</a>, there are several steps that must be done in the proper order.  The guide is well laid out and easy to read.  On my Ubuntu powered workstation I installed what I thought were all the required packages.  I discovered after the fact that to get Octopress to work on Ubuntu, you must install Node.JS as your javascript engine or else it doesn&#8217;t work.  I tried to use &#8216;therubyracer&#8217; first but it didn&#8217;t allow me to generate the pages.</p>


<p>The second snag I hit was trying to get the order right for using <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/" target="_new">Github Pages</a>.   Where this got confusing to me was that the Octopress guide is clear, but when you setup the github pages repo, Github tells you to clone it.  You do not want to do this.  You want to stay in the Octopress folder you setup and follow the guide to setup the pages and generate the site.  If it fails to work you can always delete the site and recreate it since you have not saved anything there yet.</p>


<p>The last thing I would recommend is to update the _config.yml file right away before you generate the pages for the first time.  Get things setup nice and clean for yourself.  You might even want to preview the content prior to doing the the first &#8220;rake deploy&#8221; by using &#8220;rake preview&#8221; and opening your browser to localhost:4000.</p>


<p>These notes are of great benefit to me, and if they help anyone else awesome.</p>


<p>BOOT NOTE: if you ever have the issue when running &#8220;rake deploy&#8221; where it throws an error saying &#8220;! [rejected] master -> master (non-fast-forward)&#8221; the fix is quite simple (Thank you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17609453/rake-gen-deploy-rejected-in-octopress">StackOverflow</a>.<br />Just do the following:<br /><code>cd octopress/_deploy<br />git pull origin master<br />cd ..<br />rake deploy</code></p>
